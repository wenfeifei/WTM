@model WalkingTec.Mvvm.Core.BaseVM

    a {
        color: #01aaed
    }
</style>
<p>When you publish the code, you need to pay attention to one point</p>
<p>By default, dotnet core 2.1 does not support embedding pages into DLL, which can't be seen during local debugging, but after publishing, there will be a problem that pages can't be found.</p>
<p>The solution is to modify the project file, add<CopyRefAssembliesToPublishDirectorytrue&lt/CopyRefAssembliesToPublishDirectory&gtï¼Œexmple:</p>
<img src="~/imgs/publish.jpg" /><br /><br />

<script>
  $("#@Model.ViewDivId").parent().css("height", "auto");
</script>
